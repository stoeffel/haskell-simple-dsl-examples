# Building DSLs in Haskell

Simple playground for DSLs in Haskell.

Most of this is inspired by the following great blog posts:
* https://deque.blog/2017/12/08/continuation-passing-style-free-monads-and-direct-style-free-monads/
* http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/06/you-could-have-invented-free-monads.html?m=1

You can use ghcid to run the examples.
```bash
$ ghcid --allow-eval "command=stack ghci [filename]"
```
Change `--- $>` lines to `-- $>` and you will see the result in ghcid.
